# A-Frame MIDI controller example
WORK IN PROGRESS, restored from the ashes of failed experiments 

Example, demonstrating WebMIDI in [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/). Live at https://i3games.github.io/aframe-midicontroller/

I use an AKAI LPD8 to change the sphere's position and colour.

MIDI Notes: 36, 37 (toggle sphere position)
MIDI CC: 1, 2, 3 (change sphere colour)

At the moment it works as such, probably needs a user gesture to start soon.
