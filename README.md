# A-Frame MIDI controller example

Example, demonstrating WebMIDI in A-Frame

WORK IN PROGRESS, restored from the ashes of failed experiments 

I use an AKAI LPD8 to change the [A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) sphere's position and colour.

MIDI Notes: 36, 37 (toggle position)
MIDI CC: 1, 2, 3 (change colour)

At the moment it works as such, probably needs a user gesture to start soon.
